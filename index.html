    <!-- <h1>Armand Lachand</h1> -->
<p>I am a freelance researcher in Mathematics and Computer Science. After a Ph.D. in Number Theory at the University of Lorraine under the supervision of CÃ©cile Dartyge, I am currently working on Cryptoanalysis, Machine Learning and Optimization and the eventual interactions between these fields.</p>

<p> I strongly believe in open philosophy, particularly Open Science, Open Source and Open Datas. You can learn more about it in the <a href="open-philosophy">Open Philosophy" section</a></p>
